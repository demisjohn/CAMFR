COMPILING AND INSTALLING

The following instructions apply for use of package installer `homebrew`. Legacy instructions below were also showing
use of MacPorts for older version of python and it has not been tested

# Installation with `homebrew`

Install brew (https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) and Xcode ((from the App Store or from the apple developer website), agree to the Xcode license and install the Xcode command-line tools.

Install the following brew package:
$ brew install texlive
$ brew install boost boost-python3
$ brew install gcc lapack blitz scons

Use pyenv (https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install your favorite python 3 version.

install CAMFR python requirements:

$ pip install requirements.txt

$ cp machine_cfg.py.MacOSX-brew machine_cfg.py

check paths in machine_cfg.py - and run installation

$ pip install .

# Installation with MacPorts - and python 2.7

(this won't work on Apple M1 where python 2.7 is deprecated)

For the compilation of CAMFR on MacOSX, it is relatively straightforward to use MacPorts to install all dependencies, although with the drawback that the built-in Mac OS installation of Python will be superseded by the MacPorts python installation.
The following instructions will install a new Python 2.7 interpreter, alongside your built-in MacOS Python installation. Be sure to used the correct python shell when running the CAMFR install script, and note that CAMFR will only be installed to this particular python interpreter unless you manually copy the module into another `site-packages` folder.

First, download & install MacPorts.  Follow the simple instructions here:
	https://www.macports.org/install.php
Make sure to also install Xcode (from the App Store or from the apple developer website), agree to the Xcode license and install the Xcode command-line tools, as mentioned on the MacPorts installation page.
Once MacPorts is installed, run `sudo port selfupdate` in the terminal to update all the sources and port lists.

Install all the required CAMFR dependencies with this command:
	sudo   port install   boost +no_single -no_static +python27   blitz +gcc5     lapack +gfortran   llvm-3.3   scons   py27-Pillow   py27-spyder
This requires an internet connection and can take a while to download and build every package.

This will install the following MacPorts packages +variants (and @version used in the tested build):
	py27-Pillow @3.2.0_0 (replaces PIL)
	blitz @0.10_4+gcc5
	boost @1.66.0_0+no_single+no_static+python27
	lapack @3.7.1_0+gfortran
	llvm-3.3 @3.3_10
	scons @3.0.1_0
	py27-spyder @2.3.8_0 (could replace this with py27-scipy if you don't want the IDE)

The above command will also install the following ports, as dependencies:
	gcc5 @5.5.0_0 (also installs 64-bit gfortran libraries, unlike XCode's 32-bit versions)
	py27-scipy @1.0.0_0+gfortran
	py27-numpy @1.14.1_0+gfortran
	py27-matplotlib @1.5.1_2+cairo+tkinter
	blitz @0.10_4+gcc7
	(among many many others)

Make a link to the gfortran compiler via:
	sudo   ln -s   /opt/local/bin/gfortran-mp-5   /opt/local/bin/gfortran


Install the CAMFR library by typing 'sudo python2.7 setup.py install' from the CAMFR directory.  The command `python2.7` should run the MacPorts python installation - you can check this via `which python2.7` and make sure the executable is located within the "/opt/..." MacPorts directory.
This will first build the CAMFR library, and then install it to the MacPorts python2.7 `site-packages` directory.  See below to compile the documentation camfr.pdf PRIOR to installation.

Due to a bug in the setup.py script, we lastly must rename the camfr compiled library, via
	sudo mv   /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/camfr/_camfr.dylib   /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/camfr/_camfr.so

You'll notice that the camfr docs failed to build & install, unless you have a TeX installation active. This would produce the camfr.pdf documentation file within the camfr module folder.
To have this build and install as well, you must install TeX, via
	sudo port install   texinfo (and maybe texlive-basic)
Then run the docs makefile; 
	cd camfr/docs; make
The camfr.pdf file is now available in the docs folder.  You can copy it to a location of your choice, or a subsequent run of `sudo python2.7 setup.py install` will then copy the PDF into the CAMFR module folder in site-packages.

Tested on macOS 10.12, 10.13, on MacBook Pro 2010 and 2017.
