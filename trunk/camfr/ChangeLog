CAMFR 1.1:

 - improved stability for Slabs
 - Python doesn't terminate abruptly anymore when faced with some user
   errors or lost modes
 - animation of field profiles is much smoother (Lieven Vanholme)
 - field plots can be saved in a variety of formats (jpg, gif, png, ...)
   Animations can be saved as an (uncompressed) animated gif (Lieven Vanholme)

     e.g. plot_field(s, lambda f : f.E2().real, r_x, r_z, "field.jpg")

 - plot_n and plot_field now works for BlochStacks, BlochModes and Cavities
   too
 - added Stack.fw_bw(z), which returns a tuple of the expansion 
   coefficients of the forward and backward field at position z in the Stack

     e.g. fw, bw = stack.fw_bw(0)

 - Cavity.find_modes_in_region() has been renamed to Cavity::find_all_modes()



CAMFR 1.0 (2002-09-24):

 - faster binaries, especially under Windows, which can be up to three
   times faster than CAMFR 0.9
 - new way of defining complicated structures using geometric shapes and
   automatic discretisation
 - more excitations for cartesian structures: gaussians, plane waves 
   and arbitrary shaped functions (Lieven Vanholme)
 - support for stacks terminated by an infinite repetition of a basic 
   period
 - more robust method of calculating Bloch modes (Lieven Vanholme)
   and their field profiles
 - Matlab link under Windows is by default enabled and installed
 - integrated plotting and animation routines for field profiles in a stack
   (Lieven Vanholme), optionally using Matlab as backend
 - added stack.n(), stack.mu() and stack.eps()
 - added Poynting vector components field.S1(), field.S2() and field.Sz()
   and its magnitude field.abs_S()
 - better handling of loosely coupled or degenerate waveguides
 - better handling of metals, also metals with purely imaginary refractive
   index
 - more flexible way of plotting field profiles of modes
 - CAMFR now runs reliably under graphical IDE environments like Idle
   or ActiveState's PythonWin
 - various documentation updates and minor bugfixes
 - more graceful handling of user errors

Important to note if you are upgrading from a pre 1.0 version of CAMFR are
the following changes:

 - set_left_wall and set_right_wall are replaced by set_lower_wall and 
   set_upper_wall respectively
 - imaginary thicknesses and coordinates are deprecated: PML is set by
   set_lower_PML, set_upper_PML and set_circ_PML



CAMFR 0.9 (2001-09-06):

 - initial public release
