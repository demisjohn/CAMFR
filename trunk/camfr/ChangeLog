 - Better handling of near-singular matrices in GARCLED.py.

CAMFR 1.3:

 - Added code to model spontaneous emission and light extraction in light
   emitting diodes, both for planar structures and for structures with a
   2D periodic grating in the cavity or in the substrate. 
 - Now a BlochStack can also be used inside a Stack, either as first term,
   last term or both:

      bs = BlochStack(...)
      s = Stack(bs(0) + ... + bs(0))

   In this case, the reflection and transmission coefficients relate to
   BlochModes, rather than to the SlabModes in the last slab of the 
   BlochStack, which is much more useful. (Pieter Dumon)
 - All plotting functions like plot(stack), animate_field(), ... are now
   class member functions and need to be called as stack.plot().
 - By default, NumPy and matplotlib are imported to create a more 
   complete Matlab-like environment. SciPy is also required for the RCLED
   modelling code.
 - Added Dispersive_Material_Factory, to make it easier to work with 
   materials whose index is defined as a table in a text file.
 - Reworked manual, a.o. integrating plotting more with the rest of the 
   examples.
 - Better stability when joining together two slabs which are each other's
   mirror image. (This can occur when modelling triangular lattices.)
 - New solver for 1D slabs based on adaptive spatial resolution. Very useful
   for metallic structures. (Peter Debackere)
 - Stack.fw_bw() and BlochMode.fw_bw() can now take an optional extra argument
   to specify the limit value of z, i.e. Plus or Min.
 - get_kt() and set_kt() for Planars now works again (Peter Vandersteegen).
 - Fix field plot bug for Planars.
 - The wavelength can now be complex (Thanks to KC Huang for requesting this)
 - Extra stability when working with backwards and complex modes.
 - The 'filename' argument in the plotting functions is now a named argument 
   rather than a positional one, i.e. it has to be specified by 
   filename="string", rather than just by "string" on the correct position.
 
CAMFR 1.2 (2003-11-12):

 - circular structures can now have multiple radial discontinuities (Mihai
   Ibanescu)
 - interactive plotting utilities (Lieven Vanholme) to look at fields,
   animations, Poynting vectors, save to file, zoom in, ... . Try 
   plot(Stack), plot(Slab), plot(BlochStack)
 - improved stability for Slabs, especially for wide photonic crystal
   structures
 - a new solver suitable for high loss materials. See set_solver(series)
 - added various small utility functions: Stack.width(), BlochStack.width(),
   Cavity.width(), Cavity.length(), Cavity.bot_stack(), Cavity.top_stack()
 - the MATLAB bindings are updated to the latest versions of MATLAB and
   pymat (the latter needs to be installed separately from 
   http://pymat.sf.net) (Ross Stanley)


CAMFR 1.1 (2003-03-05):

 - improved stability for Slabs
 - inc_S_flux and ext_S_flux are now much faster
 - Python doesn't terminate abruptly anymore when faced with some user
   errors or lost modes
 - the refractive index profile can now be displayed on top of the 
   field plots (Lieven Vanholme)
 - animation of field profiles is much smoother (Lieven Vanholme)
 - field plots can be saved in a variety of formats (jpg, gif, png, ...)
   Animations can be saved as an (uncompressed) animated gif (Lieven Vanholme)

     e.g. plot_field(s, lambda f : f.E2().real, r_x, r_z, "field.jpg")

 - plot_n and plot_field now works for BlochStacks, BlochModes and Cavities
   too
 - added Stack.fw_bw(z), which returns a tuple of the expansion 
   coefficients of the forward and backward field at position z in the Stack.
   Also works for Blochmodes.

     e.g. fw, bw = stack.fw_bw(0)
	  fw, bw = blochstack.mode(0).fw_bw(0)

 - Cavity.find_modes_in_region() has been renamed to Cavity::find_all_modes()
 - the constructor for Cavity has been changed from Cavity(top, bottom) to
   Cavity(bottom,top). This makes the coordinate system more intuitive.
 - arbitrary sources can now be placed inside a cavity

     e.g. cavity.set_source(fw, bw)

 - fixed memory corruption when doing exotic things with Expressions
 - fixed crash when plotting uniform layers or planars


CAMFR 1.0 (2002-09-24):

 - faster binaries, especially under Windows, which can be up to three
   times faster than CAMFR 0.9
 - new way of defining complicated structures using geometric shapes and
   automatic discretisation
 - more excitations for cartesian structures: gaussians, plane waves 
   and arbitrary shaped functions (Lieven Vanholme)
 - support for stacks terminated by an infinite repetition of a basic 
   period
 - more robust method of calculating Bloch modes (Lieven Vanholme)
   and their field profiles
 - Matlab link under Windows is by default enabled and installed
 - integrated plotting and animation routines for field profiles in a stack
   (Lieven Vanholme), optionally using Matlab as backend
 - added stack.n(), stack.mu() and stack.eps()
 - added Poynting vector components field.S1(), field.S2() and field.Sz()
   and its magnitude field.abs_S()
 - better handling of loosely coupled or degenerate waveguides
 - better handling of metals, also metals with purely imaginary refractive
   index
 - more flexible way of plotting field profiles of modes
 - CAMFR now runs reliably under graphical IDE environments like Idle
   or ActiveState's PythonWin
 - various documentation updates and minor bugfixes
 - more graceful handling of user errors

Important to note if you are upgrading from a pre 1.0 version of CAMFR are
the following changes:

 - set_left_wall and set_right_wall are replaced by set_lower_wall and 
   set_upper_wall respectively
 - imaginary thicknesses and coordinates are deprecated: PML is set by
   set_lower_PML, set_upper_PML and set_circ_PML



CAMFR 0.9 (2001-09-06):

 - initial public release
