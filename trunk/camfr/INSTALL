INSTALLATION

For the compilation of CAMFR, a C++ compiler is needed that supports
many features from the latest C++ standard. Use e.g. a recent version
(3.0.4 or later) of the gcc compiler from http://gcc.gnu.org.

CAMFR also requires the following external programs or libraries, 
which must be installed first. The use of the lastest versions is 
recommended.

- Python 2.2 or later from http://www.python.org
- The Scons builing tool from http://www.scons.org
- Numerical Python from http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy
- The Boost Python Library from http://www.boost.org. A CVS version is
  needed, for instructions on how to get it, see 
  http://mail.python.org/pipermail/c++-sig/2002-February/000815.html
  For builing it, use a command like e.g. 
      jam -sTOOLS="intel-win32" -sBUILD=release 
      -sBOOST_ROOT=D:/boost_cvs/boost/ 
      -sPYTHON_VERSION=2.2 -sPYTHON_ROOT=C:/progra~1/python22
- a recent snapshot of Blitz++ from http://oonumerics.org/blitz
- the Fortran linear algebra libraries BLAS and LAPACK, which you can get from 
  http://www.netlib.org. If possible however, use a vendor-supplied version 
  for maximum performance.

Now edit machine_cfg.py to adjust the location of these libraries, as well
as other machine-dependent parameters and compiler flags. There are some 
examples in the files machine_cfg.py.{various_platforms}.

Install the CAMFR library by typing 'python setup.py install'.
