INSTALLATION

For the compilation of CAMFR, a C++ compiler is needed that supports
many features from the latest C++ standard. Use e.g. a recent version
(2.95.3 or later) of the gcc compiler from http://www.gnu.org/gcc.

CAMFR also requires the following external programs or libraries, 
which must be installed first. The use of the lastest versions is 
recommended.

- Python from http://www.python.org
- Numerical Python from http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy
- The Boost Python Library from http://www.boost.org
- a recent snapshot of Blitz++ from http://oonumerics.org/blitz
- the Fortran linear algebra libraries BLAS and LAPACK, which you can get from 
  http://www.netlib.org. If possible however, use a vendor-supplied version 
  for maximum performance.

Now edit make.inc and setup.py to adjust the location of these libraries, as well
as other machine-dependent parameters and compiler flags. There are some examples
in the files make.inc.{various_platforms}.

Install the CAMFR library by typing 'python setup.py install'.
