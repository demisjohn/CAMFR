 one place) http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/223972
-Use scons Clean function
-remove old mode profile calculator
-Section sorter to mode.h
-Numeric is imported automatically. Remove from docs and examples.
-move to uBLAS? (www.genesys-e.org/ublas)

 (e.g. circ_disp -> CircDisp, Material_length -> MaterialLength, ...)
-use BaseMaterial where appropriate
-completely redesign / rework Expression and its link to Stack
-make state of inc_field_bw consistent when calling set_interface_field
